  <p>
Beat egg until fluffy.
Add milk and melted margarine.
Add dry ingredients and mix well.
Heat a heavy griddle or fry pan which is greased with a little butter on a paper towel.
The pan is hot enough when a drop of water breaks into several smaller balls which 'dance' around the pan.
Pour a small amount of batter (approx 1/4 cup) into pan and tip to spread out or spread with spoon.
When bubbles appear on surface and begin to break, turn over and cook the other side.
